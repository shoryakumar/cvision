# Cvision - AI-Powered Cataract Detection App

Cvision is an AI-powered mobile application designed for cataract detection using deep learning. The app detects an eye in an image and classifies it as either *Cataract* or *Normal* using TensorFlow Lite models. Additionally, it features a eye chatbot integrated with the Gemini API.

## Features 🚀
- **AI-Powered Cataract Detection**: Uses multiple TFLite models for accurate classification.
- **Eye Detection Preprocessing**: Ensures valid input before processing.
- **Cataract Chatbot**: Provides eye-related assistance using the Gemini API.
- **Multiple Model Options**: Users can choose from three models or use an averaging method.
- **Flutter-Based UI**: Smooth and intuitive user experience.
